      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a passionate B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (Class of 2026) with a strong foundation in Python, web development, and AI/ML systems. 
        I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and am constantly learning new technologies to build smarter, faster, and more user-friendly applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond tech, I lead the AWAAZ Club, where I organize literary events and foster creative expressionâ€”skills that complement my technical problem-solving with strong communication and leadership.
